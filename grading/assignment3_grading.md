## Exercise 1

### Q3 - 1 point

Is the source code included?

- No
- Yes

### Q4 - 1 point

Are the likelihood, prior and the posterior for computing the average hardness value reported? It is ok to refer to the book instead of deriving the distributions.

- No
- Yes, but some are missing (0.5p)
- Yes

### Q5 - 1 point

In part a), were the point estimates and posterior interval provided? (The posterior mean should be close to ... and 95% posterior interval should be around [..., ...])

- No
- Yes, but seem incorrect or only one estimate was reported (0.5p)
- Yes, and the reported values seem plausible

### Q6 - 1 point

In part a), was the density plotted?

- No, or obvious incorrect results
- Yes, but results seem incorrect due to minor mistake (0.5p)
- Yes, and the plot seems plausible

### Q7 - 1 point

For b)-part, was a formula or a simulation method presented for computing the posterior predictive distribution? It is ok to refer to the book.

- No, or obvious incorrect results
- Yes, but results seem incorrect due to minor mistake (0.5p)
- Yes

### Q8 - 1 point

For b)-part, were the point estimate and predictive interval provided? (95% predictive interval should be around [...,...] and the mean the same as in part a).

- No, or obvious incorrect results
- Yes, but results seem incorrect due to minor mistake (0.5p)
- Yes, and the reported values seem plausible

### Q9 - 1 point

For b)-part, was the density plotted?

- No, or obvious incorrect results
- Yes, but results seem incorrect due to minor mistake (0.5p)
- Yes, and the plot seem plausible

## Exercise 2

### Q10 - 1 point

Is the source code included?

- No
- Yes

### Q11 - 1 point

Are the likelihood, prior and the posterior for the death probabilities reported? It is ok to refer to the book instead of deriving the distributions.

- No, or obvious incorrect results
- Yes, but results seem incorrect due to minor mistake (0.5p)
- Yes

### Q12 - 1 point

In part a), was the simulation algorithm for computing the posterior of the odds ratio presented or implemented?

- No, or obvious incorrect results
- Yes, but results seem incorrect due to minor mistake (0.5p)
- Yes

### Q13 - 1 point

In a)-part, was the odds ratio summarized with a point estimate and a posterior interval? (The mean should be close to ... and 95% posterior interval approximately  [..., ...])

- No, or obvious incorrect results
- Yes, but results seem incorrect due to minor mistake (0.5p)
- Yes, and the results seem plausible

### Q14a - 1 point

In part b), was testing alternative priors provided?

- Not at all
- Some analysis was provided but it was lacking or did not make sense
- Some alternative priors were tested


### Q14b - 1 point

In part b), was some discussion about testing alternative priors provided?

- Not at all
- Some analysis was provided but it was lacking or did not make sense
- Some sensible discussion was provided

## Exercise 3

### Q15 - 1 point

Is the source code included?

- No
- Yes

### Q16 - 1 point

Are the likelihood, prior and the posterior for the windshield hardness values reported? (It is ok to refer to the book or related formulas from exercise 1)

- No, or obvious incorrect results
- Yes, but results seem incorrect due to minor mistake (0.5p)
- Yes

### Q17 - 1 point

In part a), was the simulation algorithm for computing the difference in the means presented or implemented?

- No, or obvious incorrect results
- Yes, but results seem incorrect due to minor mistake (0.5p)
- Yes

### Q18 - 1 point

In part a), was the posterior for the difference between the means summarized with point and interval estimates? (The mean should be close to ... and 95% posterior interval [..., ...] or something close to it)

- No answer or obvious incorrect results
- Yes, but only one estimate was given
- Yes, and results seem reasonable

### Q19 - 1 point

In part b) was some analysis and discussion provided for assessing whether the means could be exactly the same?

- No answer or obvious incorrect results
- Yes, but the analysis or explanation seems incorrect due to minor mistake
- Yes
