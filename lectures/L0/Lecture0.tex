\begin{frame}{Course information}
The aims of this course are that you should:\\[3mm]\pause
\begin{enumerate}
\item get a good knowledge of a large number of machine learning models,
\item become able to use methods for evaluating and improving predictive models,
\item become able to handle big data,
\item become able to train and use machine learning models in R,
\item become able to train and use neural networks using Keras/TensorFlow.
\item become able to describe and discuss ethical aspects of big data and black box-models,
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Pre-requisites}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Basic terms of probability theory
    \begin{itemize}
    \item probability, probability density, distribution
    \item sum, product rule, and Bayes' rule
    \item expectation, mean, variance, median
  \end{itemize}
  \item Some linear algebra and calculus
  \item Basic visualisation techniques (R or Python)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item histogram, density plot, scatter plot
  \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  First assignment is a recap.

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Course Outline}
Two main parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item Core Content (9 lecture blocks)\pause
\item Assignments (8 individual assignments)\pause
\item Mini-project on a supervised project (2-3 students)\pause
\end{itemize}
Exact dates and details; see the course page.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Core Content}

\begin{itemize}
\item Two lectures/computer labs (approx. 4h)
\begin{itemize}
\item Lecture(s): present overall theory and content (overview)
\item Computer labs(s): Hands on help with the assignment if you get stuck. \emph{Start before the computer assignment!}
\end{itemize}
\item Online video material and reading assignments (approx. 4-6h, 50-90 pages a week)
\item \emph{Note!} There might be some overlap between reading instructions.
\item An individual computer assignment (approx. 12-16h). Deadline Sundays 23.59.\pause
\item Recommended workflow for each week
\begin{itemize}
\item Do the reading assignments
\item Attend lecture
\item Watch the videos (although, optional)
\item Do the assignment
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%% OK



\begin{frame}{Assignments}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Both implementation of core components and state-of-the-art methods\pause
\item \emph{Warning!} There might be bugs in the assignments!\pause
\item All labs can be turned in a three times. Deadline last day of course and one month after last day of course.
\item We will mark and return each assignment within 10 working days.
\item \emph{Important!} Do not write your name anywhere and do the assignment evaluation!
\item Three one hour zoom seminars per week with individual help on assignments.
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

%% OK

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{R vs Python}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item We strongly recommend using R in the course as there are more
    packages for Stan and statistical analysis in general in R
  \item If you are already fluent in Python, but not in R, then using Python
    may be easier, but it can still be more useful to learn also R
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

% OK


\begin{frame}{Stan}

  Stan is a probabilistic programming framework and ecosystem

  40+ developers, 100+ contributors, 100K+ users

  R, Python, Julia, Scala, Stata, Matlab, command line interfaces

  More than 120 R packages using Stan

  Many packages to support diagnostics and workflow

  Can be used for frequentist inference as well

\begin{frame}{Mini-project}

\begin{itemize}
\item See project instructions on webpage for details.\pause
\item Supervised problem of choice on real data.
\item 2-3 students.\pause
\item Supply a half-page project proposal of data and problem at the end of block 6.\pause
\item Project will last two weeks (half time) - but start earlier.
\item Approximate 40 hours of work \emph{per student}.\pause
\item The project should result in a 4 page report (PDF) using the ICML LaTeX template (see course page).
\item Project oral presentation (10-15 minutes)\pause
\item Each student will review one other project:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a 1-2 page review of the report.
\item Discuss at the oral presentations.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Practicalities}

\begin{itemize}
\item Course page/content: Github -- please do a PR if something is wrong!\pause
\item Communication: Studium\pause
\item Schedule: Time Edit/Studium
\item Assignments submissions: Studium\pause
\item Acknowledgements: Aki Vehtari\pause
\item Teaching assistant: Väinö Yrjänäinen
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Literature}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Book: Gelman, Carlin, Stern, Dunson, Vehtari \& Rubin: Bayesian Data Analysis, Third Edition. {\footnotesize (online pdf available)}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=2.6cm]{figs/BDA3.jpg}
  \end{center}
  \item Additional articles and blog posts
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Examination}

\begin{enumerate}
\item To pass (G): All labs, mini-project, and project review need to be passed\pause
\item To pass with distinction (VG): 7/10 VG points\pause
\item Each assignment has an extra (VG) task worth 1 VG point.\pause
\item The mini-project is worth 2 VG-points (if it is passed with distinction).
\item Ph.D. students: I suggest you get VG to pass the course. Make the project a potential paper.
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Course improvements since last time}

\begin{itemize}
\item Optional VG assignments and clearer info on how to get VG
\item More even burden (hopefully)
\item General updates of unclear parts in assignments
\item General question in each assignment (4-5 paragraphs)
\item \emph{Note!} There can be some new bugs after these updates.
\end{itemize}
