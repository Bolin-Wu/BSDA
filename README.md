# Bayesian Statistics and Data Analysis (BSDA) course (2ST128) at Uppsala University

Welcome to the GitHub repo for the Bayesian Statistics and Data Analysis at Uppsala University. This repo contains all necessary material and information for the course. 

The course is build upon a similar course given at Aalto University. This course can be found [here](https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/index.html).


## Course Target Audience 
The course is given to second-year master students in the Statistics masters program and interested PhD students.

This course has a strong emphasis in computational aspects of Bayesian data analysis and using the latest computational tools.


## Prerequisites and Course Goals
See course syllabus with course goals [not here yet](https://www.uu.se/en/admissions/freestanding-courses/course-syllabus/?kpid=39843&type=1).

The basic prerequisites can be summarized in:
- Basic probability theory:
  - probability, probability density function (pdf), distribution, 
  - sum, product rule, and Bayes’ rule
  - expectation, mean, variance, median
- Some linear algebra and calculus
- Basic programming in R (main language) or Python


## (Rough) Course Plan and Reading Instructions
You can find a rough course plan with reading instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTMN6pWULQIs_klRyunyS3OiQZ5ty67Smljo6gcxc1dQ68c4dDoZlSJTmDowYixvPZpANqDhSIA40Cs/pubhtml).


## Schedule
You can find the course schedule on TimeEdit [here](https://cloud.timeedit.net/uu/web/schema/) (search for course code 2ST128).


## Grading
The course is graded with U (Underkänd/Fail), G (Godkänd/Pass), VG (väl godkänd/Pass with distinction).

To pass, you should pass all assignments and the mini-project. 

On each assignment, if everything is correct, a VG point can be awarded. Similarly on the mini-project, 2 VG points can be awarded. A total of 7 or more VG points is needed to get VG on the course. 


## Course Literature and Video Material
Below are the main references for the course.

### Literature

### Complementary Reading

Below are some suggested complementary reading for the interested student.

- For regression models, their connection to statistical testing and causal analysis see Gelman, Hill and Vehtari, “Regression and Other Stories”.
- Richard McElreath’s Statistical Rethinking, 2nd ed book is easier than BDA3 and the 2nd ed is excellent. Statistical Rethinking doesn’t go as deep in some details, math, algorithms and programming as BDA course. Richard’s lecture videos of Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course Using R and Stan are highly recommended even if you are following BDA3.
- For background prerequisites some students have found chapters 2, 4 and 5 in Kruschke, “Doing Bayesian Data Analysis” useful.



### Video material

- Akis videos

## Recommended workflow for each block/assignment

1. Read the literature according to the rough course plan
2. Watch the videos to get more indepth knowledge/understanding (however, optional)
3. Do the assignment

## Course practicalities

Online course discussions will be held at Studium.


### Location

Most lectures will be held on campus. There might be a guest lecture that will be held over Zoom. The computer lab will be held through zoom to facilitate many sessions.

You can find information and support for students on Zoom [here](https://mp.uu.se/c/perm/link?p=267521030). 

## Teachers

Main Teacher: Måns Magnusson
Teaching assistant: Väinö Yrjänäinen

## Course structure

### Main part
The course consists of rougly 8 blocks (weeks) of material. Each week consists of the following (expected workload in parenthesis):
- One to two lecture(s) and computer labs (approx. 2-4h per week)
- Online video material and reading assignments (approx. 2-6 h per week)
- An individual computer assignment (approx. 10-12 h per week)

### Computer assignments
Each week an individual computer assignment is done with a focus on computational aspects of Bayesian Statistics. Each assignment is completed individually and should follow the computer assignment template.

Students should return the computer assignments no later than **Sunday 23.59 each week**. A second possibility to turn in assignments is possible after the end of the course. For a detailed list of deadlines, see the [course plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTMN6pWULQIs_klRyunyS3OiQZ5ty67Smljo6gcxc1dQ68c4dDoZlSJTmDowYixvPZpANqDhSIA40Cs/pubhtml).

After the last (second) possible time to turn in the assignment no more chances will be given. In this case, you will be failed on the course and you will need to retake the course next year.

Each assignment will be graded and evaluated within 10 working days.

### Bayesian Model Averaging
A guest lecture will be given on by Ph.D. student [Valentin Zulj](https://katalog.uu.se/empinfo/?id=N19-813).

## Course Mini-Project
The last two weeks will focus on a course project where 2-3 students choose their data and will conduct a Bayesian data analysis of the given data.
